                                <h3>Are DJI drones getting banned?</h3>
                                <p>BY BRANDON RUSSELL | June 21, 2024</p>

                            <p>
                                The future of DJI (Da Jiang Innovations) drones is metaphorically up in the air as the Countering CCP Drones Act, 
                                introduced by Representative Elise Stefanik (R-NY), gains more support in Congress, raising the possibility of a nationwide ban in the U.S.
                    
                                Proponents of the bill cite national security concerns, alleging DJI drones are providing data on critical infrastructure in the United States 
                                to the Chinese Communist Party. If passed, the bill could significantly impact the drone industry in the U.S. and potentially affect consumers 
                                who rely on DJI drones for recreation, commercial applications and public safety initiatives like search and rescue missions. DJI is fighting 
                                the ban through lobbying efforts and more.
                    
                                In a nutshell:
                                The U.S. government may ban DJI drones, concerned that China is collecting information through them.
                                This would impact several areas of the consumer market and commercial drone market.

                                Following unanimous approval by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the bill is making its way through Congress and 
                                could later land on President Joe Biden’s desk. The legislation proposes adding DJI to a list maintained by the 
                                Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019. 
                                This would block DJI’s drones from running on communications infrastructure in the U.S., according to “The New York Times,” 
                                effectively rendering them unusable. While the bill has received wide bipartisan support, DJI has vehemently voiced its 
                                opposition.
